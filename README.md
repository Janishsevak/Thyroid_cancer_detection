Thyroid Cancer Classification Project
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based solution to classify thyroid cancer cases using clinical and diagnostic data. By accurately predicting the presence of thyroid cancer, this system can assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

Dataset Description
•	Source: Provided dataset containing clinical diagnostic features.
•	Rows: 383
•	Columns: 17 (16 features + 1 target variable)
•	Target Variable: A binary variable indicating the presence of thyroid cancer (1 for positive, 0 for negative).
Sample Features:
•	TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)
•	T3
•	Thyroglobulin
•	Tumor size
•	Age
•	Gender

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
The dataset underwent the following preprocessing steps:
1.	Missing Value Handling: Imputed missing values using the median for numerical features and the mode for categorical features.
2.	Feature Encoding: Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
3.	Scaling: Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.
4.	Dimensionality Expansion: Created polynomial features to improve model performance.
2. Feature Engineering
Enhanced the dataset with:
•	Interaction features between diagnostic tests.
•	Polynomial transformations for key features.
3. Model Training
Three machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	Random Forest Classifier
3.	XGBoost Classifier
The dataset was split into an 80-20 train-test ratio. Models were evaluated on the test data.
4. Experiment Tracking with DagsHub and MLflow
•	DagsHub Integration:
o	The project is versioned on DagsHub, where both the dataset and model artifacts are tracked.

o	The repository URL https://dagshub.com/Janishsevak/Thyroid_cancer_detection

o	MLflow is configured with DagsHub's tracking server to log metrics, parameters, and model artifacts.

•	MLflow Integration:
o	MLflow is used to track experiments, log model parameters, metrics, and confusion matrices.
o	Experiment results are accessible via the MLflow UI in DagsHub.

The evaluation metrics for the models are as follows:
Confusion Matrix
Predicted	0 (No Cancer)	1 (Cancer)
0 (Actual)	58	0
1 (Actual)	1	18
Classification Report
Metric	Class 0	Class 1	Weighted Average
Precision	0.98	1.00	0.99
Recall	1.00	0.95	0.99

Challenges & Solutions
1.	Imbalanced Data: Addressed by evaluating precision and recall, ensuring that the minority class (cancer cases) was accurately classified.
2.	Feature Importance: Utilized tree-based methods to identify and retain important features.
3.	Overfitting: Prevented through hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques.

Future Work
•	Real-World Validation: Test the model on an external dataset to verify generalizability.
•	Explainability: Incorporate SHAP or LIME to provide interpretability for predictions.
•	Deployment: Deploy the model as a web application using Flask/Django.
